  This is the readme file 
  
  This repository contains the some basic algorithm or function in python language .
  
  In this repository we will see some basic concepts of the probablity and applying them to calculate some basic situation probality and try to make some algoritm for the basic problems.
  In the first file we introduced some basic concepts of the probability like probaility distribution, Probability Mass Function, Distribution Function, we will alo see the Methametical terms of the probability by using the LaTex format for Mathemetical expression and equations.
